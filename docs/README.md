# Docs

Docs generated with [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and the [Just the Docs theme](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

Local docs can be run using `make docs` from the project root, or `docker-compose up` from the `/docs` folder.
